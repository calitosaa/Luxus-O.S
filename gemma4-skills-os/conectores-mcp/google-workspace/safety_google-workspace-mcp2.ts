/**
 * Safety policies — interceptors for destructive or sensitive operations.
 *
 * These run as beforeExecute hooks in the factory pipeline, before any
 * service-specific patches. They provide a cross-service safety layer
 * that can:
 *
 * - Block operations entirely (throw)
 * - Downgrade operations (send → draft)
 * - Require confirmation context (params that prove intent)
 * - Log/audit destructive actions
 *
 * Policies are composable — multiple can apply to the same operation.
 * They're configured per-deployment, not per-service.
 *
 * Example use cases:
 * - "Draft-only mode" — agents can read email but not send
 * - "No-delete mode" — prevent permanent deletion across all services
 * - "Audit mode" — log all write operations to stderr
